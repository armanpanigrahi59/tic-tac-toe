🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Java Console Game)

A simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game written in Java that runs directly in the console.
Players take turns marking cells with X and O, and the game checks for wins or draws automatically.

🧠 Features

Two-player mode (Player X vs Player O)

Input validation (prevents overwriting occupied cells)

Automatic win and draw detection

Clean, grid-style console interface

Simple, beginner-friendly Java code

🛠️ Requirements

Java JDK 8 or higher

Any IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) or terminal

🚀 How to Run

Clone or download this repository.

Save the file as TicTacToe.java.

Open a terminal in the file directory and compile:

javac TicTacToe.java


Run the program:

java TicTacToe


Follow the on-screen instructions:

Enter row and column numbers (0, 1, or 2).

Example: typing 0 2 marks the top-right corner.

🧩 Game Rules

The game board is a 3x3 grid.

Player X always starts first.

Players alternate turns, entering a row and column number.

The first player to align three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.
